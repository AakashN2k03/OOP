# Immutable Objects in C++

## 📌 Introduction
Immutable objects in C++ are objects whose internal state **cannot be changed** after they are created. This concept ensures **data integrity**, **thread safety**, and helps in designing **reliable** and **predictable** systems.

---

## 📚 Key Characteristics of Immutable Objects
1. **Constant Members**: Use `const` for member variables to make them **read-only** after object construction.
2. **No Setters**: Do **not** provide methods to modify object data.
3. **Initialization via Constructor**: Values must be assigned **only once** during object creation.
4. **Copy/Assignment Restriction (Optional)**: You can disable copying and assignment to enforce stronger immutability.

## 📖 Example: Creating an Immutable Object
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class ImmutablePerson {
public:
    const string name;
    const int age;
    
    // Constructor to initialize the object
    ImmutablePerson(const string &personName, int personAge)
        : name(personName), age(personAge) {}

    // Getter methods to access values
    string getName() const {
        return name;
    }

    int getAge() const {
        return age;
    }

};

int main() {
    ImmutablePerson imp("king", 22);
    imp.name("Queen")    // ❌ Error: cannot modify name as it is constant
    cout << imp.getName() << " " << imp.getAge() << endl;
      //second obj'
    ImmutablePerson imp2("king1", 2);
    cout<<imp2.getName();
    cout<<imp2.getAge();
    return 0;
}
```

## 🤔 Why Use & with string and Not with int?

**Efficiency in Memory Usage:**

- string objects are complex data structures that involve dynamic memory allocation. Passing them by reference (using &) prevents unnecessary copying.

- int is a primitive type and small in size (4 bytes), so copying it is inexpensive and efficient.

**Avoiding Unnecessary Copies:**

- Without &, passing a string creates a new copy, which is inefficient for large strings.

- Copying primitive types like int is fast and does not require special handling.

**Performance Consideration:**

- Use const string & for large or complex data types.

- Use plain types (like int, char, float) by value for better performance in simple scenarios.

## 🧠 Why Use `const` for Members?
1. **Prevents Modification**:
   - **`const`** ensures that once a member variable is initialized, it **cannot** be modified later.
2. **Thread Safety**:
   - Immutable objects are inherently **safe for concurrent access** because no thread can alter their state.
3. **Predictable Behavior**:
   - No unexpected changes to object properties, leading to more **reliable** code.

## ❌ Common Mistakes and Errors

### 1. Attempting to Modify `const` Members
```cpp
imp.name = "newName";  // ❌ Error: Assignment to a const member
```

### 2. Incorrect Syntax for Accessing Members
```cpp
imp.name("newValue");  // ❌ Error: Trying to call a member as a function
```

### 3. Forgetting `&` with String Parameters
```cpp
ImmutablePerson(const string personName, int personAge);
// ❌ Inefficient: Causes an extra copy
```
✅ **Fix:** Pass `const string &` to avoid copying.

### 🛠️  Using `const` with Methods
```cpp
// Ensures the method doesn't modify the object
string getName() const;
```


## 🔍 When to Use Immutable Objects
- **Multithreaded Programs**: Prevents race conditions.
- **Caching Systems**: Ensures cached data stays unchanged.
- **Functional Programming Paradigm**: Promotes pure functions and immutable data structures.
- **Sensitive Data**: Ensures important data remains unmodified after initialization.

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations
- **Pros**:
    - Easier debugging due to predictable states.
    - Safer multi-threading without locks.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires creating new objects for any modification.
    - More memory usage if creating many new objects.

---

### ✅ Best Practices
- Use `const` for member variables.
- Provide only **getter** methods.
- Delete copy constructor and assignment operator if necessary.
- Always initialize `const` members via ***member initializer lists***.
