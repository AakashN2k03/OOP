# Pure Virtual Functions (Abstract Functions)

## 1. What is a Pure Virtual Function?
A pure virtual function is a function declared in a base class that must be overridden in derived classes. It has no function body in the base class and ensures that every derived class provides its own implementation. A class containing at least one pure virtual function is called an **abstract class** and cannot be instantiated.

### Syntax:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};
```
❌ No function body in the base class!  
✅ Must be overridden in the derived class!

---

## 2. Why Use Pure Virtual Functions?
✅ To force derived classes to provide their own implementation.  
✅ To create an abstract base class that cannot be instantiated.  
✅ To enable runtime polymorphism.  

---

## 3. Example of a Pure Virtual Function

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {  // Abstract base class
public:
    virtual void makeSound() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks!\n";
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Cat meows!\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    // Animal a; ❌ ERROR! Cannot create an object of an abstract class
    Dog d;
    Cat c;

    d.makeSound();  // Calls Dog’s version
    c.makeSound();  // Calls Cat’s version

    return 0;
}
```
### Output:
```
Dog barks!
Cat meows!
```
✅ `makeSound()` is implemented in each derived class.  
✅ The base class `Animal` cannot be instantiated because it has a pure virtual function.

---

## 4. What Happens If a Derived Class Does Not Override the Pure Virtual Function?
If a derived class does not override the pure virtual function, it also becomes an abstract class and **cannot be instantiated**.

```cpp
class Bird : public Animal { };  // Does not override makeSound()
```
❌ ERROR: `Bird` is still abstract because it did not override `makeSound()`.

---

## 5. Can a Pure Virtual Function Have a Body?
Yes! A pure virtual function **can have a body**, but only in the base class. However, derived classes **must still override it**.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0 {  // Pure virtual function with a body
        cout << "Base class show()\n";
    }
};
```
⚠️ Rarely used, but allowed!  
✅ Derived classes must override the function but can call `Base::show()` if needed.

---

## 6. Key Features of Pure Virtual Functions
✅ Declared using `= 0` in the base class.  
✅ Forces derived classes to override it.  
✅ Makes the base class **abstract** (cannot create objects of it).  
✅ Used in **polymorphism** to ensure derived classes provide their own implementations.

## 7. Real-World Use Cases
- **GUI Systems** – A `Shape` class with a pure virtual `draw()` method that must be implemented by `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.  
- **Game Development** – A `Character` class with a pure virtual `attack()` method for `Warrior`, `Mage`, etc.  
- **Operating Systems** – An `OS` class with a pure virtual `boot()` method for `Windows`, `Linux`, etc.

## 8. Difference Between Virtual and Pure Virtual Functions

| Feature           | Virtual Function                                    | Pure Virtual Function                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | A function in the base class that can be overridden but has a default implementation. | A function in the base class that must be overridden and has no default implementation. |
| **Implementation in Base Class** | Can have a function body. | Cannot have a function body (unless optional). |
| **Overriding in Derived Class** | Optional (derived class may or may not override it). | Mandatory (derived class must override it). |
| **Base Class Instantiation** | The base class can be instantiated if all functions are defined. | The base class cannot be instantiated (it becomes an abstract class). |
| **Use Case** | When you want to allow derived classes to optionally override a function. | When you want to force derived classes to implement their own version of the function. |

---

## 9. Syntax of an Abstract Function
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;  // Abstract function (Pure Virtual Function)
};
```
🔹 The `= 0` syntax means the function is **pure virtual (abstract)**.  
🔹 The base class becomes an **abstract class**, meaning it cannot be instantiated.  

---

## 10. Conclusion
✔ **Virtual Function** → Can be overridden, but not mandatory.  
✔ **Pure Virtual Function (Abstract Function)** → Must be overridden in derived classes.  
✔ **Abstract Class** → A class that contains at least one pure virtual function and cannot be instantiated.
